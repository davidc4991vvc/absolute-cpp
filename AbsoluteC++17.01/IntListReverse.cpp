Write a void function that takes a linked list of integers and reverses the order of its
nodes. The function will have one call-by-reference parameter that is a pointer to
the head of the list. After the function is called, this pointer will point to the head
of a linked list that has the same nodes as the original list but in the reverse of the
order they had in the original list. Note that your function will neither create nor
destroy any nodes. It will simply rearrange nodes. Place your function in a suitable
test program.
